<br/>

```node getLeaderboards.js <season>``` This will get the top 50 in that season logged in the console, for the set season. It will list the username, ranking, amount of trophies and the user id of said person.
<br/>

```node api.js <user id>``` This will show your stats in a very messy manner in the console, it has every recorded stat
<br/>

```node getProfile.js <user id>``` This will get some of your stats, not all of them, but in a very neater format, so it's more legible. 
<br/>

```node getSkin.js <user id>``` This will fetch the skin the user is currently using, it is unclear if WPG has made skin updating delayed for less targetting, and thus unclear if this is delayed or not.
